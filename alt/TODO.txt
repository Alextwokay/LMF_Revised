// POSSIBLE ADDITIONS

AI MORTAR (must be not op and reliable)
AI JET CAS (same as mortar)
BARRICADES (must be performance friendly [and best like ai scripts only executed on var_spawner])
WRECKS (same as barricades [maybe even combinable with barricades])
ANIMALS (same as barricades [maybe even combinable with barricades])
WEAPON JAM (seems to work perfectly [but disable by default and make briefing less deceiving, because it doesn't accurately reflect what is/isn't turned on])
LIMB CRIPPLING (with ace medical rewrite on the way I think this should stay mission based and not actually be added to the framework?)
GARRISON (there is a garrison script from nkenny in the unused folder...I think it would be useful as a secondary more controlable garrison script if modified)


// PERFORMANCE 

EVERYTHING (ideally all sctipts should be looked through and "modernized" if possible)
EVERYTHING (ideally all scripts should be looked through and redundant shit should be removed)
IF POSSIBLE MAKE SCRIPTS "WORK BETTER" TOGETHER (use functions, eventhandlers and compile instead of execVM etc...)

// OTHER THOUGHTS

JIP (kullervo suggested that the jiping function should be overworked because it seems to suck?)
CLEANING PT.1 (not sure how usefull some files are like the cfg_base and cfg_players for example)
CLEANING PT.2 (if possible I'd like to get rid of some shit I always questioned why its even needed like the cfgNotifications example in description.ext)
CLEANING PT.2 (there is a "debug" mode param that does nothing and seems to stemm from the /f folder. generally speaking the shit in the /f folder...well lets just say I'd prefer if it went away as its pretty much just some shit straight up ripped from the F3 framework and like...2/3 of it isn't even used.)
